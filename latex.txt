\section{ \textbf{Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm and Particle Swarm Search for Global Optimization.\\}
This paper proposed an algorithm for enlightening the convergence speed, Good point set theory was used to generate the initial population. In order to increase the exploitation ability, the three types of bees were utilized the mechanism of PSO in search of new candidate solutions. To develop the searching ability, the chaotic search operator is applied in the best solution of the recent iteration.

\section{ \textbf{Application of Chaos Ant Colony Neural Network in Slope Stability Analysis.\\}
This paper suggested that the ant algorithm and backpropagation neural network is vulnerable when searching in a continuous space. It is vulnerable in the local optimum. This paper introduced a new algorithm called chaos ant colony. It is used for the optimization of weights of the neural network. It is also a dynamic model which has a mode of slope stability analysis.

\section{ \textbf{Designing Convolutional Neural Network Architecture by the Firefly Algorithm.\\}
This paper uses Firefly Algorithm for training Convolutional Neural Network. CNN is used for computer vision related application like image classifications. It can deliver successfully in this domain. One of the drawback of this algorithm is the values of hyper-parameters which has significant impact of its generated results. This paper uses firefly algorithm to optimize these values of hyper-parameter. The result is tested using the MNIST dataset and compared with some other meta heuristic algorithm.

\section{ \textbf{Classification of remote sensed data using Artificial Bee Colony algorithm.\\}
This study presented a model using Artificial Bee Colony and Neural Network algorithm for analysis of satellite data. Traditional statistical methods ignored the spatial distribution of pixels only considering the spectral equivalent to the land cover classes and association between various bands. The proposed model uses object detection n and cataloging in several areas sidestepping the problems related to band correlation. The result is compared with some traditional algorithm.
 The results is showing that the proposed model is performing better in terms of quality and quantity than the other algorithms. However, a limitation seems to be occurred applying this method. It is identifying the classes. Scoot bees identify the classes which seems to be a large number in feature space. When the threshold reaches maximum iteration some scout bees then converted to onlooker bee. The classification rule can use XOR condition for recognize the classes.\cite{ten} }.

\section{ \textbf{Classification of DNA microarrays using artificial neural networks and ABC algorithm.\\}
This research paper proposed a methodology to classify DNA microarray. This method makes a feature selection process based on a swarm intelligence algorithm for finding a subset of genes that describe the attributes of a disease. At the same time this algorithm implements the ANN in the fitness function and make a dimensional reduction, provoking that the discrete evaluation be more time consuming and used more computational resources. To make the ANN perform efficiently this paper reduce the number of gene by classifying them using Euclidian distance and then train the ANN with the classified gene to classify DNA microarray.
The result is good for finding gene of some disease. The dataset was challenging and the algorithm did well.\cite{twelve} }.
